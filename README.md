# Global Terrorism & World Happiness Report Analysis

This project explores the relationship between terrorism incidents and socio-economic factors across countries from 2007 to 2017. Using data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and the World Happiness Report (WHR), this analysis aims to uncover patterns that link terrorism prevalence with indicators such as GDP per capita, social support, happiness, and personal freedom.

## Project Objective
